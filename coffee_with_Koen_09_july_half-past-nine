# Reload Job application for an Agile project Manager

## I am applying at Reload for a job because...

Open source is the future. Closed source is evil. Making money by exploiting the ignorance of people on the importance of access to the source code is just bad. Especially if there's a better way. Contributing to Reload would be living the dream. I would be doing the right thing and work in a software environment I believe in. 

I am a bit of an unusual open source crusader. I am trained in economics and worked as a corporate stooge for most of my career. Even though I believe in the importance of code I can produce little myself. I run arch linux on my laptop because it's for power users, however sometimes I secretely long back to linux mint because there the "fn" buttons on my Asus laptop just magically work. 

However I am very good with people. I like meeting other people, getting to know them finding out what makes them tick. I am extrovert. And I am good at organising things. I get things done. Last but not least I have good business knowledge. Being an economist and a corporate stooge does come with the perks of understanding financial statements, budget cycles and the horrible bureaucracy.  

I love good sci-fi. Escpecially those with an unexpected but scientifically sound plot twist in the end. If you haven't had a sci-fi thrill of late, I can recommend Chappie (and district 9) and Interstellar. Fantasy is my next favorite genre. Because let's face it, who doesn't want to have pointy ears, long hair and be badd-ass with a bow! In computer games I go for turnbased games with roleplaying elements. Xcom is my all time favorite. Xcom2 coming out in November!

## Next steps

- Rasmus: So lets see your credentials
- Rasmus: You do not need to see my credentials
- Koen (making a small hand gesture): you do not need to see my credentials
- Rasmus: We do not need to see his credentials
- Koen: I am the agile project manager you are looking for.
- Rasmus: He is the agile project manager we are looking for. 
- Koen: You will have coffee with me on the 9th of July at half past nine. 
- Rasmus: We will have cofee with Koen on the 9th of July at half past nine.


If the above Jedi mind trick failed, I would like to humbly ask if I can drop by for coffee on the 9th of July in the morning. It would be a good opportunity to get to know each other better and for me to experience a software company that works in a way I believe in. I know there's a place for an odd, extrovert nerd like me. I hope I can convince you of that. 

If you don't have coffee tea is also fine because after all: "Tea! That's all I needed! Good cup of tea! Super-heated infusion of free-radicals and tannin, just the thing for healing the synapses.‚Äù
